# ☁️ Serverless Functions Framework

This project is a simplified framework for modeling the execution of serverless functions, similar to platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. It is implemented using **Java** and **Scala**, combining object-oriented and functional programming paradigms to simulate a distributed serverless system.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The main goal of this practice is to explore the concepts behind serverless computing by:

- Modeling function deployments and executions.
- Simulating a runtime environment where multiple serverless functions can be triggered.
- Providing basic abstractions for event-driven execution.
- Implementing the logic in both Java and Scala to understand language differences and strengths.

The framework does **not** rely on actual cloud infrastructure but rather focuses on the **design and architecture** of a serverless runtime using advanced programming techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Scala 3
- sbt (Scala Build Tool)
- Maven / Gradle (for Java setup)

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project was designed to practice:

- Functional vs Object-Oriented programming
- Concurrency and event-driven programming models
- Language interoperability (Java + Scala)
- Clean architectural design and abstraction

## 👨‍💻 Developers

- Miguel Robledo Kusz  
- Víctor Fosch Tena

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of the *Advanced Programming Techniques* course at the **Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV)** in Tarragona, Spain.
